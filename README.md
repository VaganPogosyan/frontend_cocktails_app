## Overview

The purpose of this app was to create basic database and API integration for "proof-of-concept" and "technical feasibility" to integrate into a future social cocktail app where users can have their own list of recipes and share with others.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express server
- MongoDb
- React
- Bootstrap, react-bootstrap CSS
- Deployed app on Heroku

## Unsolved Problems

- Table of ingredients not rendering as intended
- Ability to update recipes needs a cleaner interface

## Notes on Next Steps

- refactor front-end to change user workflow to make it more intuitive and user friendly
- complete redesign of UI using react router (we didn't know about that until Wednesday)
- combine show components into a single show cocktail component
- fix bugs
